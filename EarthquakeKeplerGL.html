"><b>About this map</b>
<p>This map visualizes earthquake events from 2010 to 2024 based on their geographical locations, magnitude scales and magnitude types. The points represent the locations of earthquakes worldwide. When zoom out the cluster points visualize aggregated of average magnitudes based on a geospatial radius. The earthquake's magnitude is depicted using a color scale, allowing viewers to quickly identify the intensity of each seismic activity.</p>

<p>The map is also enriched with additional details about types of magnitudes, and the temporal distribution of these events. The border color represents the magnitude type of each event.</p>
<p>Time playback at the bottom of the map  allows users to visualize how the events change over time. This is particularly useful for datasets that include a time dimension.</p>
